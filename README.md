# simple-rpg-engine
A simple pixel style RPG game engine.

This is a project I am working on for the experience. It uses Lua (https://www.lua.org/) for scripting and SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics. These dependencies are already included in the project.
It also includes tmxlite and its own dependencies (https://github.com/fallahn/tmxlite) to incorporate Tiled maps (https://www.mapeditor.org/).

The source code is licensed under MIT, including the Lua source code which I put under the folder SFMLGame/lua5.3.5.
